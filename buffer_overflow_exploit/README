We can call the secretFunction by just modifying the input.
There are better ways to do this if the binary is local.
We can use gdb to modify the %eip.
But in case the binary is running as a service on some other machine,we can make it call other functions or even custom code by just modifying the input.

compile vuln.c
	for 32bit system:	gcc vuln.c -o vuln -fno-stack-protector
	for 65bit system:	gcc vuln.c -o vuln -fno-stack-protector -m32
see the disassembly of the binary.
	objdump -d vuln
