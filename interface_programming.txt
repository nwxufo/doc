Where find the syscall table for Linux?
	1. find / -name syscalls -type d
	As a programmer, We written code oriented to compiler, SO it useful to ask the compiler directly.
	 `printf "#include <sys/syscall.h>\nSYS_read" | gcc -E -`
	 for  32-bit x86
     `printf "#include <sys/syscall.h>\nSYS_read" | gcc -m32 -E -`
Maybe I want to output to the terminal the value of some global/standard definitions of C/GCC,
	`echo __GNUC__ | gcc -E -`
	`echo -n "#include <stdlib.h>\n errno" | gcc -E -`
